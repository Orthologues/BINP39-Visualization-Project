CpG,The CpG sites or CG sites are regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide in the linear sequence of bases along its 5' → 3' direction. CpG sites occur with high frequency in genomic regions called CpG islands (or CG islands). Cytosines in CpG dinucleotides can be methylated to form 5-methylcytosines.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site,A meta-analysis of nonsense mutations causing human genetic disease,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/humu.20763,8

Ka/Ks ratio,"dN/dS ratio or ‘ω’. It is used to estimate the balance between neutral mutations, purifying selection and beneficial mutations acting on a set of homologous protein-coding genes. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (Ka), in a given period of time, to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks), in the same period.
