CpG,The CpG sites or CG sites are regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide in the linear sequence of bases along its 5' → 3' direction. CpG sites occur with high frequency in genomic regions called CpG islands (or CG islands). Cytosines in CpG dinucleotides can be methylated to form 5-methylcytosines.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site,A meta-analysis of nonsense mutations causing human genetic disease,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/humu.20763,8
