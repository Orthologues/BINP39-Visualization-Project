const GENERAL_INTRO_TEXT = `This web-app was developed for protein variation analysis. With the help of this tool, structural reasons behind the loss of stability in protein structure due to amino acid substitution can be analysed; also, unknown protein variants can be modeled and conclusions on sterical effect of substitutions can be made.
AA-Clash Prediction(home) part of this web-app calculates the distances between atoms of the new substituted amino acids and the surrounding atoms in the protein structure and identifies if clashes in the structure would form or not. Clash is considered to be a strong overlap between van der Waals radii of the atoms.
Input for AA-Clash prediction can be provided in 2 ways: either uploading your own PDB format file or listing PDB database accession codes. In both cases, a list of specific positions and/or substitutions can be provided.
This web-app also provides molecular visualization for PDB-ID and specific AA-substitutions of AA-Clash code-queries by Jmol. Additionally, visualization by 3Dmol is available.
UI-access to RCSB-PDB's API to fetch basic information of PDB-IDs of AA-Clash code-queries, as well as mapping to relevant Uniprot-IDs, are available at this web-app as well.

>2zxc

History of AA-Clash queries in PDB-CODE mode would be preserved in local storage until deletion by client side's clicking event.
